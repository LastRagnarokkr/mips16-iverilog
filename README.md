# mips16-iverilog
A processor implementation in Icarus Verilog (iVerilog), 16bit MIPS format.

Processor behaviour:
1. Processor waits at PC0 until rst from processor_tb.v is enabled (high), after which program counter module begins counting and counter value is sent to instruction memory as input for address fetching.
2. Current PC is sent to pc_add module where it is incremented by 1 and passed to wire pc_inc
3. Instructions memory sends its PC address to instr_bus wire where it is passed to subsequent modules.
4. Control unit (CTU) takes instr_bus 3 MSBs (opcode) and evaluates control signals to be enabled.
5. Registry file sends and takes values as instr_bus and CTU instruct.
6. ALU takes registry output 1 as input 1 and ALU source MUX output as input 2 and performs its operation as selected by ALU control, which takes its instructions from instr_bus and CTU also.
7. Data memory module takes ALU result as address value and registry output 2 as data input, which are evaluated according to CTU enable signals, memory_write, memory_read, respectively.
8. All MUXâ€™s take their select signals from the CTU, except branch MUX which takes its select from amod1 module. amod1 takes CTU branch and ALU branch enable signals and evaluates them with a AND gate. 
9. Program counter is updated from pc_loopback which is from JRMux output, the last MUX in datapath, and the cycle continues with the new value. 

Notes about the processor:
 - Some modules variables are initialized to zero for simulation purposes. These are ignored during synthesis. 
 - Single cycle processing. 
 - Test programs currently need to be written into the processor instruction and data memory manually.
 - Registry is assumed to be initialized to zeroes during rst LOW.
 - Processor is not designed structurally.
 - <b>Processor does not appear to be working correctly when inspected via GTKwave, odd behaviour related to timing is present.</b>
 
 Currently missing from repository, to be added:
 - Instruction reference table
 - Datapath visualization/drawing
 - Registry reference table
 - Test Program
 - Detailed code comments with intentions/function
